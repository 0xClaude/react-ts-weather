# react-ts-weather

A simple weather app made with vite and react. It uses the OpenWeather API under the hood. Just enter the city name and enjoy your five day weather forecast.

This is my first TypeScript project, so it took me longer than planned (roughly one day). A selfmade hook is fetching data from the API.

# Usage

`VITE_API=YOUR_KEY`
- Install the dependencies:
`npm install`
- Start the server
`npm run dev`
- Enjoy

# Todo

- Pimp the interface
- Refactor maybe
